         <p> While this was a very complicated class for me, I'm very grateful to have this oppurtunity to learn how to code. The Vercel was probably my easiest aspeect that we learned, but I really enjoyed Vanilla Javascript and doing the Todo app as well. I can't wait to continue learning next semester. </p>
